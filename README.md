# Why did I create Locus Quarter and why it should help you

I was actively searching for houses, to buy one. 10's of houses on various house search websites like funda.nl.
When we search for a house/property, we also try to find out what are the things near that property, that are important to us. Like: Grocery, Bus stop, School etc.
These preferences, vary from person to person.

Every time, I liked a house, I had to open Google Maps, put in the house address, search for places around me with different criteria, time taken to reach destinations, mode of transport and so on.

Well, I thought, as I know, what to search for, in the houses like price range, location etc and also places/amenities near by, can I not automate this?

Now, when I wake up in the morning, I have an email which
- Filtered list of the houses based on my criteria
- The places/amenities near that house
- Distance and travel time to those places in various modes of transport
- Distance to my office (a place where you go almost everyday)

# Getting started
### Get your Google API Key
- [Get your Google API key to access Google Maps & Geolocation Services](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key) - Select Maps, Routes, Directions (all options)

### Configuring GMail for Email (Optional)
Note: Email is optional (default off). I have done this since I found the setup of gmail, tricky for beginners
- [Enable your GMail API from your account](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) - Save the credentials.json/client_secret.json (filename as defined in your configuration file)
- gmail-python-quickstart.json - Generate this and save it as filename as defined in your configuration file. This file contains access token and refresh token

### Baseline configuration before execution
  - Use Python 3.7
  - Install dependencies (in an virtual env, if you please to and use python 3.7)
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - Update the config-locus-quarter.ini with the API Key
  - Update the config-locus-quarter.ini as per your search criteria (Example in the repository as example-config-locus-quarter.ini)

# Execute & Enjoy the results
Retrieve details from the RSS feeds (URL configured)
```shell
python locus_quarter.py
```

Retrieve details only for specific address
```shell
python locus_quarter.py --address="Henriette Bosmanslaan 2, 1187 HH Amstelveen, Netherlands"
```

You can have multiple configuration files, by default config-locus-quarter.ini is referenced. To use a customized configuration file named config-mini-locus-quarter.ini
```shell
python locus_quarter.py --config="config-mini-locus-quarter.ini"
```

Combining address and customized configuration file
```shell
python locus_quarter.py --config="config-mini-locus-quarter.ini" --address="Henriette Bosmanslaan 2, 1187 HH Amstelveen, Netherlands"
```

If you have configured your email using GMail, you can get emails by adding a flag --email=true :
```shell
python locus_quarter.py --email=true #Retrieve details from the RSS feeds

python locus_quarter.py --config="config-mini-locus-quarter.ini" --email=true #Specific configuration file based

python locus_quarter.py --config="config-mini-locus-quarter.ini" --address="Henriette Bosmanslaan 2, 1187 HH Amstelveen, Netherlands" --email=true #Specific configiration file and specific address
```

# Sample Output
The email will have a nice subject, Locus Quater. It can be sent to mutiple receipients.
Output can also be watched on the console.
